Some Rules regarding creating the components- 
1. Write clean code with only the necessary code and use comments wherever needed as it will make it easier for me to do routing later.
2. Use React with Javascrpit to create components and create a different folder for each of the component , the folder shall containe a jsx file and a css file related to the component. Ex -  AboutUs -> { AboutUs.jsx , AboutUs.css}.
3. Please use correct naming conventions, don't just name your variables something like "a" or "b", the variable names should be descriptive. File and folder names should also be descriptive.
4. Don't use any css framework such as bootstrap or tailwind as most of the members don't have a clue about it.
5. Make sure to create a new branch and switch to it before making any changes.
6. No need to do npm i or create a react vite app just simply start by creating a new folder for your specific page in the components folder.
